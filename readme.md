# Google Cache Site Recover

It will rebuild your site with the same folder structure. In case you have URLs
without one extension, will add .html because without this, your OS will not
allow create deeper links

## How fast is?

By Default, will make requests to Google Cache each 63 to 70 seconds. At time
of this documentation, for **more than 59 pages Google WILL block your IP for
~8h if you try more faster**.

Proxy requests still not implemented

## Why?

Site was lost in firestorm SBG2 OVHâ€™s Strasbourg Data Center. Need to be recovered.

Also, this keep in mind that use of this service is againts Google ToS.
